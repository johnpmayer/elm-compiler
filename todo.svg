change the SVG BasicElement constructor to remove the w/h attributes
create the recursive data structure to hold SVG nodes

begin to test adding webkit 3d transforms on <g> svg elements

move all SVG stuff out of Element.elm into SVG.elm, work on making it "native" (compiled by elm2js)
likewise from Element.js to SVG.js

add more data constructors for Primitives and Transforms.

figure out a good way to represent mesh models. [STriangle] ?

this may rely on a mechanism for declaring svg primitives with vertices in (x,y,z). Can this be native?
